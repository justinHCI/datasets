hello hello I'm Justin I'm Alison and this is episode  of robots on typewriters yeah and what is robots on typewriters typewriters oh yeah - your turn to answer robots on typewriters is a podcast where we talk about funny and entertaining stuff that people make using computers AI randomisation hmm just those three things yeah only those three things nothing else don't even talk to us about anything else if it doesn't fall into one of those other categories one of those three categories computational creativity can't remember if I said that already but yeah that's what we do and we have two segments on this podcast and the first one is our zesty hat and it is my turn to put that guy on I feel like I haven't had this SD hat on in a while it feels feels different I mean it's yeah it's it's been in the fridge for a long time it's like when you have leftovers that have been in there for like a while and they start to get a little like squishy or something mmm yeah that's the thing yeah um but yeah I have a little bit of a two-part hat this week there's a big hat and then a little hat on top like a side er I want to do yeah yeah it's a hat it's a little tiny hat just hanging off the big hat I was going to do these things in reverse because I was originally gonna do this as I thought I had a little Twitter bot corner but it turns out the Twitter bot is there it's a lot more than Twitter bot and it's really cool so I wanted to talk about that a little deeper but I did want to mention the our friends over at BOTS Nick Studios collaborated with CollegeHumor again which is super dope and oh about a week ago or so they put out a video The Game of Thrones finale rewritten with AI so what they did is very similar to the last time they worked with CollegeHumor they trained a a bunch of botnet keyboards on you know a bunch of different parts of the game of thrones scripts I suppose and wrote up a new script for the for the Game of Thrones finale and it and then the the folks at College Humor acted it out and it is very very funny and something that struck me about why it's it's so who's so cool that that they do this kind of thing is because college humor is you know a company or a you know a creator that has the resources to really like employ the absurdity of what the Botnick scripts come out with yeah dare I say neither of us are like big Game of Thrones fans I think we both kind to watch some of season  and then birds Zack this is dumb yeah but no this was funny even to us and yeah I dare I say better than season eight probably yes so definitely check that out my my real hat the big hat this week is I find y'all hat for my sham friends and champagne for my real friend Samwell for my hat friends for my bad rent yeah I came yeah I can't because this little Twitter bot this week it's called at dreamer game bot um the the kind of title of the Twitter account is dreamer of Electric Sheep and I didn't really understand what's going on basically the description of it is I don't know what I am maybe you can help tweet commands at me and I'll choose one of them to do once per minute I was made by at TCC oxo n so that's who made this but so the the tweets are kind of like you know people tweet out at things like for example create a salad and the bot responds saying I have a salad it is a prepared solid food it has an effect of suppressing hunger and a fresh vegetable inside is a grape so so there's kind of like like the I'm out of the tweets are like it almost seems like a like a chief Botts done quick kind of format where it looks like there's a like an origin and then there's words filled in mad lib style and the words that are filled in are in bold so you can tell which ones the bots kind of threw in there and it's like the pre-existing sentence structure also in the description of the Twitter bot there is a link to an itchy Oh page where you can interface with this bot like whenever you want it's it's it's kind of just like a chat bot and if you type in help you get a list of all of the commands and things you can ask it and talk to it about basically it says I can look around I can look at things I can enter places I can leave places I can go through doors I can go along roads I can ride vehicles I can go north east south west up and down I can go to places I have an inventory I can take things I can drop things I can give things I can create things so um it's it's really I've been I was playing around with it a little bit this morning I'll kind of run through the interaction we had because it's really sweet so when you opened it when I opened it up it kind of like said something to begin with it was like I don't know what I am maybe you can help I'm at Mars it's a planet just like Earth it has moons Phobos there is an ocean a Martian and red dust here I told it to go to the ocean he was like I went to the ocean it is a it's a great mass of water it has water salt and seaweed it has a living thing a living animal and a wave there is a shark and a starfish here told it to ride the shark I rode the shark to the beat to a beaches of Australia there is a shark and another shark here talk to the other shark I told it to I wanted to make it try to create I didn't know what would happen if I told it to create something so I said create a hat it said I have a hat it's a form of clothing it has a brim within it is a be felt and a feather so I think there's a bee in his bonnet his bonnet so I told them to look at the and he's he said the bee is in the Hat it's a venomous animal and so I said drop the because I thought that would be safest in this situation he said I don't have to be yeah do you come to drop the beat I didn't um I'll see what he says he probably would say he doesn't have the beat which he just he's too humble that's far yeah yeah but I told him to create a house and he said I have a house it's a home for a human it has wiring and clack it has a floor a yard a window a wall an entranceway and a chimney what is called like a CLA quue I don't know it must be a house thing [Laughter] and then I told him to go to the floor uh he said I went to the floor it's a person supporting it's a person supporting object he said there's a cat and a chrome here told him to take the cat and take the chrome I told him to give the crumbs of the cat that's that and then I told him oh another on a clack sorry to interrupt no I'm sick of antek followers or a group higher to applaud or heckle a performer that's in his house he's got a clack that's the only definition that I can find okay that's very bizarre maybe I'll have to see what he says it's like how his hat had a B yeah it's like I told him to ride the cat and he rode the cat to a clean washing there is a cat and another cat here I told him to take the cat and the cat he said I took the cat I have it it's a talisman it has an adult female body it has a whisker and I a leg a claw a litter of kittens and a crumb and told him this is the last thing I told him to do I told him to look at the mouse the mouse is in the cat it's an input device it has a but it has a short lifespan inside it is a spleen so it was funny to me it's like this weird like conglomerate understanding of a mouse being like both the computer mouse and a living Mouse because it has a mouse button but also it has a spleen inside but yeah that that was a long-winded rundown of my little conversation with this guy because I was just thoroughly enjoying it but basically I could have explained this before I went into all that but um what it is so this of this I can't remember if I had mentioned this this little game was created for proc GM  we've talked about proc Jam before it's a game jam where people make games or tools or different kinds of cool things that use procedural generation to make other cool things and this thing is did all of the kinds of like things and the collection of objects that it has and what it kind of knows about them is drawn from something called concept net five which I try to look in a little bit but I figured Justin would know about this yes um do you have a better understanding of it - yeah so concept net is a very large semantic network so semantic networks are ways of representing the meanings of words so semantics is the meanings of words but a semantic network means instead of there being a dictionary definition like instead of instead of this bot or anything using concept net saying that you know a cat is a mammal that is bla bla bla bla bla every word is defined in terms of relationships to other words so all those relationships are phrases like is uh or has or is made of so like cat is a animal is made of fur and skin and whatever but so I know that the network doesn't represent any individual word as meaning but taken all together if there's lots and lots of words and concepts it can represent lots and lots of meanings and relation right between words so that's why something like the mouse having a spleen and a button might have happened right is this related to in any way to that thing that Jenelle Shane posted about a while ago that we talked about those like words yeah I forget what kind of word meant that was but yeah semantic networks or just network diagrams for language are all kind of related that way okay and a lot of AI kind of uses this style of representing words to hold meaning so a lot of chat BOTS represent words and things using something like concept net or specifically using concept net okay yeah no this is it's really cool and it's just it's it's just a very kind of fun little simple toy to toy to play around with and honestly I feel like there might be some kind of like game potential here with with or something down the road yeah I'd be able to fat to cast this guy in a RPG or something like that I mean we're so we're playing an RPG today spoilers oh you so heck we can just cast him in there right now oh that's fun what an impromptu invitation for this but um briefly to wrap up my my hat I asked him to go to the clack he went to the clack he said it's a following there's a drawer here that's it it's a following so that's that that's that's what you really like that's what I really like that streamer of Electric Sheep go talk to the dreamer we might sounds like we might be talking to him for the rest of the episode but I'm gonna take the hat off and put it on him because it's cute uh very good that's all his hat has a hat by the way yeah I'll put it on his that no longer has a bee in it so today's game thank you for that hat it's very good and it's staying on apparently because it it's it's coming right right over to the trashy toy it's my turn to make the trashy toy our trashy toy of course is the game we play in which we use some of these sorts of things that we like to talk about on this show and the last few weeks we have been obsessed with transformers Optimus Prime Megatron bumblebee oh yeah Mark Wahlberg you name them we love them no we've been obsessed with GPT - the open AI language transformer and we've been playing with it in lots of different kinds of ways and I have a new way to play with it today have you seen the transformer right with transformer tool on hugging faces website I know I believe I saw Jamie brew playing with it this exactly have you used it at all yourself no I'm not it's pretty cool what you can do it's toggleable transformer and it's basically just like a word doc and you can toggle transform or on or off so you can type some of your own stuff then let the transformer right for a little while then you can come back in and keep on writing oh that's cool okay so what I'm going to ask you to do I'm using another one of our favorite tools NPC generator and I will be you'll have so npc generator generates for you a character that has a description of who they are a personality and some kind of plot hook so I'm gonna random you up a character you're going to RP as that character but anytime you want to like take actions upon the world we're gonna write it into right with transformer and things will be resolved that way instead of like through a dice roll okay I'm so excited should I do help on NPC generator so that I have it all to me for me sure yeah you can you can be on NPC generator if you neither one of us can go ahead and do this I guess okay so let me know when you have a character and please tell me about your character so I'll have NPC generator up as well in case we actually need NPCs and one of your NPCs will be Electric Sheep Dream of Electric Sheep okay yeah I'm - yeah - reference him easily when you chat with him he's labeled as the dreamer so that's his name alright so I guess I'm gonna be playing Ian Lyn Ian Lyn calhfa's sayers a kneebar what a name Jesus it's a  year old male forest gnome artificer he is short wavy blond hair and brown eyes he has a rugged grey skin he is  feet and  inches tall he is a diamond shaped typical face he has a limp he quietly he quietly worships garl glitter gold god of gnomes protection humor trickery gem cutting that are real well D&D god are all glitter gold he shows he shows very little empathy toward others he has no self-confidence he loves shiny objects he considers everyone else's idiots he doesn't like change he sounds drooly awful yeah he's unfortunately straight on unsurprisingly single and his hook Wow wait he has an intellect score of hmm that won't matter at all intellectual out the wazoo on his plot hook he is aware rat and once you get rid of it okay he has secured his rat miss yeah we can trap all right within your party is going to be your friend the dreamer so maybe that will give us I actually already initiated the dreamer and I saw that the dreamer gave us a place so that helps the dreamer says I am at a New York it is a United States it has epidemic obesity New York Susquehanna New York Bay Queensborough bridge and ground zero Wow it has a beach and a tall building a state and it fought a lot of war there is a Spanish restaurant a theater and a steakhouse here checks out so you can go ahead and tell us what's your name again yes li jinlun yin lin it's like it's like the name Ian and then the name win-win-win ya Yin Yin 'ln Yuengling Ying Li my name is yang Ling it actually like kind of checks out for this guy somehow to call him angling yeah I like it I might just call him Yingling I'm so myself giggling so yang Ling has to cure himself of where rat nests and apparently he's in New York City which I don't know if that's a good place or a bad place for a rat what do you what do you do I told you what's around you already all right huh so wait are there other people with me or is it is just a dreamer so I'm hanging out with the dreamer yeah you can interact with others you're you're at New York there's a lot of in New York yeah yes to put it the way the dreamer put it you were well you're at a New York yes so I'm trying to how do i I'm trying to get rid of my where rat disease with my friend the dreamer here in New York City and I hate practically everybody what am I gonna do first I am gonna actually if you want to in facebook messenger send me your name and just send me the plot hook and your name we're not even your name I can just type Yingling for for right with transformer because maybe right with transformer will give you somewhere to start as well yeah yeah I think I would like to start there yeah at any point you can also just you know ask the transformer inland is a werewolf of where rat and he wants to get rid of it he's been taking pictures and trying to make out where the monster is on some old footage and what it's doing there oh oh so is there like I guess to become aware at you were bit by a we're at of course yeah obviously so is part of your journey not just to to like get rid of your own where rat nests but to destroy the way a rat that caused all this absolutely so so that's my I think that's gonna be my first course of action I am I'm I feel like the only way to get rid of my where rat disease is to kill the rare the where rat the right we're the rare wet um the the where rat that that that made me this way so I'm gonna we're going down to the sewers man that's for the rats live right I think well maybe um yeah well or we could I don't know if the the sewers or the or the the subway might be a better place it might be it might be actually better to start with the subway and not just immediately plunge into the sewers so I'm taking my I'm taking my friend the dreamer and we're going to rat hunting andis in the subway right you're going into the subway the dreamer doesn't know what the subway is yet because that wasn't in his words so I'll see what the transformer has to say okay now I just said he goes down into the subway and he doesn't want to go through the whole thing again so been been through this once before we I guess you know what that's we did we did try looking in the subway before to noloty went through the whole thing the entirety of the New York subway scene and we can't do it again come on it's it's far too far too much going on down there and all of the rats are just so stupid not none of them could have even had the wherewithal to be a where we're at is short for wherewithal right of course and so where I'm thinking that the the kingpins probably live even farther down below so I guess okay I guess it's time to plunge into the sewer he he plunges deeper into the sewer and looks for the monster that's standing on his left leg oh so we so we meet again we've already met the boss I mean this might be a yeah I come anything where you kill the where rat it doesn't get what it might just not give you what you want here you know this might not be the solution to your problem no yeah so on I I'm gonna try to grab him with my hand he's already off balance cuz he's only standing on one leg he grabs the where rat with his hand and pulls out a knife he is not sure who is going to kill him and tries to get his face smashed by a razor blade but that but the was rat doesn't do anything that would help I'm trying to make this where rat into a was rat that's my phrase I tried to get your face smashed by razor blades yeah I've been like up every night trying to write my like big one-liner for when I finally meet my favorite and turn this aware rat into a was rat is exactly what I came up with nice yeah so I pull out my knife I'm just I'm gonna think I'm gonna try to kill this rat with a knife it's kind of gruesome but I think that's what this guy would do he tries to kill the rat with the knife and ends up killing all the rats my knife slips and I kill all of the rats but here's I pick on the monster and hits with a knife but it doesn't hurt him it's still pretty bad though he's been trying to get rid of it it's not going anywhere I killed all of the rats except for the where rat he's so powerful mmm but now you can't know other person's going to be infected by other where rats it's true well yeah it was bold to change to using a toothpick on the monster yeah well I mean that's all I had other than the the knife so when the knife didn't work I thought maybe it was like a wooden stake situation and like a wooden stake for a rat is a toothpick right hmm yeah that's a good point size wise so so I tried that did that did that also fail is that what how that played out um it's unclear it says you tried to use the toothpick on the monster and hit it with the knife but it doesn't hurt him it's still pretty bad though he's been trying to get rid of it it's not going anywhere now we're just watching the rat like trying to get like mildly trying to get rid of the toothpick I think now you might want to ask the dreamer for something that he has okay as a reminder he has epidemic obesity New York susquehanna New York Bay Queensboro Bridge Ground Zero Beach a tall building a state and fought a lot of war I can also ask the dreamer to create something so I wonder yeah I can create some thing to help me here I feel like this where rat can't be killed by regular human um weapon so what if what happens if I tell what happens if I tell the dreamer to create magic create magic the dreamer said I have magic it is supernaturalism it has illusion okay um illusion magic I don't really think it's gonna do the trick here buddy I think we need something more confrontational why don't you tell him to look at the illusion the illusion is part of the magic it's an appearance inside there is an antiparticle I'll ask him to look at it the antiparticle is in the illusion it is an elementary particle would you like to try to use it against the monster let's throw that antiparticle at the rat and I've also been trying to wonder about this this boy rat is this a kind of like um is this a kind of like Fenrir Greyback situation where like he could be a human but he like embraces the the his rat nature and just like limbs as a rat full-time yeah I think this where rat is a rat the whole time but it's like a rat King but like okay yeah real gross like he could I could he be human yeah he could he hasn't been in a long time all right ah yang Ling first the antiparticle at the monster and it just dies he doesn't even have to kill the monster so it goes on to say dealing with the monster after killing the monster with his axe he picks up a hammer and starts banging it into the side of the body oh oh it's already dead though also you had an axe and a hammer all this time too why did you use the toothpick I I thought it was a wooden stake kind of situation fair enough like I was I was gonna go to the axe and the hammer next bit and I did didn't I um but yeah I was I had this kind of like next one-liner primed and ready to go but now that he's dead it's kind of anticlimactic so I'm just gonna kind of awkwardly say fight me like a man you coward no I just want to I'm gonna I'm gonna actually have you say that canonically yeah I know so hold on lately the man you coward says yin trying to win his attention you are a coward he yells and his sword shoots out at the monster you shot a sword at him yeah I have a sword gun a sword shooter I fashioned it myself I am an art I am an artificer yeah well now this monster is extremely dead are you scared um I don't know am i cured I'm gonna no no okay well that sucks why would killing a werewolf make you not a werewolf anymore I thought it might like break the curse I don't know I'm dumb he died of natural causes I'm actually really not dumb I have a intellect score I just okay so I got my I got my vengeance and I'm I'm seething covered in this small rats blood and I'm just gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna turn to the dreamer and say well this isn't gonna be anything to actually say to him I'm just basically saying it cuz he's my only companion I think this actually goes into the transformer what now what can I do to break my curse now what can I do to break my curse jinhwan asks the dreamer I need your help so I'll kill you if you do oh my god the dreamer screams don't tell me you just want my help you'll never see my brother again it was never your fault but you're just that you idiot now tell me what to do kill all of the rats before I kill you now that you know where the was rat is and if you know where I'm going to be you'll be better off than I am okay yeah well I did kill all the way I do the wet I get the rare wet um I did kill all the rats um and we do know where the was rat was and now he's a was rat I'm intrigued by the dreamer saying you'll never see my brother again me too um I don't yeah I I'm gonna oh um what if I tell the what if I tell what's a good way to phrase this to the dreamer like go to like create your like a look at your brother I don't know if he'll he might not know of a brother yet but if not I asked him to create your brother he says I have a your brother okay look at you look at your brother yeah I said look at your brother he said I have a your brother man okay here we go I said create a brother he says I have a brother it is a male sibling it has the same parents as you yeah no his brother has the same parents as you oh wait so your talent is he telling is he telling me I'll never see myself you kid are you telling or maybe he's telling me maybe he's like you killed all these rat - you're a monster I I can't even call you my own brother anymore did you know you knew the dreamer was your brother oh yeah obviously how would I not know okay do you guys have a third brother no it's just stupid okay my brother my brother yeah my brother and my brother who is me so do you want to ask him about what he means by all this sir my brother and my brother who is V would be the diplom um what did you say do you want to like ask the dreamer what he means by this yeah yeah yeah okay here's some dialogue so what mean what do you mean you'll never see your brother again asks the inland don't tell me you want me to kill you then why am I here you're my brother is that the way that's the way I like it the dreamer yells back trying to take away the power he gave Ian Lin that's that that's the way I like it so what's the power he get is that the antimatter particle yeah yeah at the end yeah I didn't know how to use it but that yeah he gave me the gift of the antimatter particle power um wait say again what he said to me so you said what do you mean I'll never see my brother again he said don't tell me you want me to kill you oh and you said that's why I'm here you're my brother because I the way I like it the dreamer yells you're my brother yeah that's the way I like things to be you're my brother but give me back the antimatter particle I don't want to kill you I don't want to I don't want to die I just want to be rid of this curse brother hmm I don't want to live like this but I don't die like a rat I don't want to live like this but I don't want to be a wuss rat want to be a was Lin so are you gonna keep the antimatter particle or are you going to give it back to the dreamer I'll give it back to him I don't know what to do with it all right and he's my brother even though I probably think he's stupid because I'm an adult like that oh but I don't like change so I don't want anything to change between us between me and my brother true inland gives the antimatter particle back to the dreamer when it's ready the dreamer fires it at the dreamer oh wait who fired the dreamer fired about the dreamer yes my brother apparently that's not all you said you you may have said my brother but then you said what's this don't we ever get that energy back okay um what does that mean I thought we were going back to our old selves the dreamer shouts at the dreamer oh my god what is happening here maybe uh what were our old selves I feel like he knows something I don't I feel like I like um I feel like I'm missing something here like maybe I'm missing some memories that the dreamer has the power of wow the dreamer yells again and tries to make inland understand why I didn't kill my brother I was just trying to make him better because he was just trying to do what his parents thought he should be doing the dreamer tells him did he turn me into the where at all along I killed the wrong rat he said if I knew about my dad you wouldn't even know I was it was rat but you do and you don't like to talk about it I thought about how I would make my brother stronger the dreamer says he inland so we don't we don't have the same dad well I guess not What did he say at first she said if I knew about my dad you wouldn't even know that I was aware rat but you do and you don't like but you do and you don't like to talk about it so the dreamer doesn't know about his dad but you inland does know about the dreamers dead or maybe your mutual dad maybe the was rat that I just killed was his dad mm-hmm it was a was dad my happy Father's Day everybody I'm Rod Serling um it was a dad rat Wow okay I accidentally just hit tab instead of tapping but I got some great dialogue you don't have I guess this is you talking you don't have a dad anymore do you why don't you make him stronger you want me to go back and prove me wrong why do you try to hurt me why don't you show me your memories show me who said that me or him I think you said that to the dreamer after he said why do you try to hurt me tell the dreamer to create a memory the dreamer says I have a memory it is hardware it has register is he an Android I'll ask no we're not I am NOT an Android just an ordinary where at which is what he is wait you're aware rat to all these years I never knew I hit tab again after you said that you also said and you told me the dreamer said yeah yeah we have that conversation years ago you just you were drunk you don't remember it yeah so apparently your brother the dreamer is aware rat what are you gonna do you gave him back the antimatter particle he has so much power against me I don't want to hurt my brother but I'm gonna pull out my sword and just brandish it and say I don't want to hurt you so young man pulls out his sword and says I don't want to hurt you what I just want to be able to see the world through you so you don't know what happened when you were aware at when you came back from that no no I don't Inland says pointing at the ground you know what what you didn't know about him wasn't so bad you knew he was aware rat so he what I think my interpretation is the dreamer was upset that you never told him about your dad about your mutual father and he's always been upset about that and you're finally now saying you knew what the truth was I am aware at because our dad was aware at I never said it but you always wanted me to say that even though you already knew that ah ok ok who I just I consulted the dreamer on his own terms ok I told him to look at the same parents as you like essentially to look at your dad ok he said I have the same parents as you inside it is a silverware Power Shovel was our dad and Android I'll ask on transformer Wow yeah so I had I put in transformer was our dad and Android Ian Lin asks yes but I don't know what we have here anymore I just know what happened I see the things you did that day you didn't kill anyone I just know that you were an Android I wasn't it hi this is so much information so our dad was an Android I was an Android our dad was also aware rats I was also aware at I'm now imagining us is like animatronic like rats in like some kind of weird cheese characters was our dad Chucky Cheese I'm askin that's the only option robot rats was our dad Chucky Cheese inland asks no he was the main character of the show and I believe that did he play Chuckie Cheese yeah and he's also an Android in Linux that was the main character of the show and I think it was Chucky Cheese yeah and I thought he was a robot that was in prison or something it's not I imagined him to be so it's like it's like Chuckie Cheese is a fictional character you dumb shit our dad was the Android who played him exactly Chucky Cheese is the name of the doctor you're thinking of chuck-e-cheeses monster I think Chuck E Cheese is the monster man okay so though it's not that what you're a rat that turns into a rat sometimes it's that you're always an animatronic rat yes so this curse is my nature there's nothing I can do about it it's not something that I was that was bestowed upon me it's part of me but my brother's not an Android right he did say that correct did he say that yeah he said no we're not I'm not an Android just an ordinary wear rat oh so he's just he's just he's aware rat you were an animatronic rat like your father chuck-e-cheese the Android actor played him so maybe maybe we need to find the nearest chuck-e-cheese and confront our dad he's gonna be there right yeah would you consider chuck-e-cheese a Spanish restaurant a theater or a steakhouse no probably a theater is the closest thing yeah I think so too so I'm telling the dreamer to go to the theater he said I went to the theater it is a building it has a green room a circle a box office and a wall there is an actor an idiot and a chair here the actor is scary the idiot diary this the narrative of this is actually phenomenal where it's like we thought we were going to kill the way AREP but he was like right there at the beginning of the story and it's like oh this is easy and now it turns out that the actual boss is our animatronic dad who is an actor who is scary yeah and does that make you the idiot ah I don't know or does he have like a wacky that's what I was thinking mm-hmm okay yeah he's got he's got a Lackey yeah um so yeah you guys are at Chuck E Cheese you found your dad and he is pissed and scary um okay I'm just gonna I'm gonna say to our dad I know you are you said I know what you are Yin Lin says to Chuck E Cheese I'm sorry to bother but I know what you are and that's what you're trying to say to me yeah yeah dad Hey You Know Who I am my dad no I just I just said that as Chuck E Cheese let's talk it out I'll play Chuck you play your you're but you're man jinlun Hey You Know Who I am yeah I don't have much to say sorry I that was me finishing my line off I didn't realize it I'm not finished okay you know who I am I don't have much to say well you better start talking dad ywír why am I like this I don't even know what it is that I don't like about myself anymore because I'm not actually aware at you better start talking to add why am I like this inland asks trying to get through to his friend I don't know I just know what you do with your time you know my artifice thing you know it's not just a phase dad this is my life I made this fucking sword gun and it's dope and I pull it out threatened I said you you know that my art efficient isn't just a phase dad this is my life I made this sword gun and it's dope inland says pulling out the sword gun to threaten him Chucky Cheese says this is for your head not mine oh this is for mine but this one was designed and made by the Creator who sent me here my design and this one's not mine and it's not mine but this one was designed and built by me but you are mine Oh dad what are you fucking talking about you're rambling again dad you're Charlie here Android you can't drink like this it goes right to your circuits who is your Creator I don't know who it is I don't know who it is but I've never thought it up and I don't know what it looks like I don't know how my head would work but now how but I know how I am you know how I look what's wrong you ask and then he inland says I just know that you don't like me right yeah to which I can just carry on since I burned your lime yeah I don't know it doesn't matter if I don't like you but you are me why because you've done this for me because I created this I gave this because I made it because I took this sword I think chuck-e-cheese is about to dramatically kill himself with the sword no I so I'm assuming he like he picked up the court the cord the sword I'm gonna try to wrestle it back from him because even though it seems like he's fucked up my whole life he is my dad the name so I said Yin Lin tries to wrestle the sword away from Chuck E Cheese and I think this is the conversation that happens during the struggle named Chuck E Cheese is what you get when you put on that hat and you see the blue green and the yellow green I'm a genius my Creator my Creator my Creator I'm the one who made the name Chuck E Cheese for you I can change anything man I can change the blue green and I can change everything for you and you'll see the future the blue green is the power all this time talking about his creator he is the creator he made this world for you identity and and kept it on himself until it was time to put it on his son uh I think I've got a resolution to all this Wow okay here we go oh my god all right the dreamer throws the antimatter particle at his father and brother hmm the rest of this is all written by the transformer okay oh boy I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna kill him how dare you do that Yin Yin Lin screams you're so stupid chuck-e-cheese yells he then goes back in his hat and starts throwing antimatter at inland if I die now Chucky Cheese I'll always have a hat and a hat you won't get another hat you won't get a hat again you will die your dad will never understand what happened you will never understand what I did to you to your mother and to all of these other people it's just madness it's not right it's not right yin lin is dead oh my god oh my god we'll never know what happened giggling we'll never know what happened to his mother yeah Chuckie Cheese just retreated into his hat through antimatter at his son's and killed presumably everyone who was our mother and now I'm really a messed up by the line what I did to your mother and all these other people I'm assuming he's planning it like a bunch of animatronics in a Chucky Cheese oh my god this is terrible he turned your human mother into an animatronic rat holy shit there's so much to unpack here but we're dead I don't even know what like I don't even know what to think but um playing that kind of thing with a transformer is so wild because it just rambles so much and it's so hard to like cling on to to what's happening and like and and I really enjoyed that we like they seemed like Chucky cheeeeese himself was into big monologues and think everything else could happen in like little blocks but when Chuck started talking it just went on yeah and that like it's actually kind of cool that like that character quick developed out of nothing yeah yeah that is so I need to like like I can't wait to edit this because I like me to understand what actually went down there I really enjoy that uh all this happened basically because we brought our hat into our trashy toy and it all resolves by going into a hat you'll never get a hat again you will die we've never done that before which was really fun it was cool to be able to use it use our hat that way um yeah hats hats have power man Oh what more can you say hats have power um well that was so fun and I'm like not against sometime somehow delving back into the chuck-e-cheese story because I think there's still there is a lot to unpack that like I couldn't even wrap my head around in this moment so um if you have any theories about what chuck-e-cheese did to our mother you can you didn't contact us and let us know because we're dying to know you can email us at robots at fat camp dot org you can tweet at us at robot typewriter or we're on Facebook but whatever bat camp in our theme song is video challenge by on a lot Iguchi yeah I'll I just want to give like see how this what the denim a is on this story I'll let the transformer write it Wow yep there's one final quote and it doesn't say who says it but it simply says you can't change what is real you can't change what is fantasy oh my god my landlords hardly yelling at each other in the room next door can you hear that I cannot hear it I always said when landlords are fighting you go anywhere else okay I can kind of hear it hey guys can we be in your pod sounds like there like it's not even that there in like this room next to me but like they're just like up against the wall like shoving the wall you're joking you're joking they're joking maybe they want to be on our comedy podcast they're gonna come over and make a smoothie soon yeah I don't want to hurt don't want to hurt my brother but I do want to hurt my landlord don't I don't want to throw the antimatter particle at your landlord yeah we'll get him to stop weed whacking the side of our house oh my god this is a nightmare oh my god just like doing laughs back and forth [Music] hello hello I'm Justin I'm Alison and this is robots on typewriters episode number  yeah that's quite a number a car it's like a round number in that both numbers are round yeah like if you draw them six hundred more and you know what that means Oh  more Devils at your door  less devil and a black dress what is robots on typewriters that's a good question I'm glad you complimented my question robots on typewriters is a podcast all about computational creativity making funny interesting artsy creative stuff with computers or letting computers make that stuff themselves on this podcast we have two segments both of which were named by a random generator the first segment is the zesty hat in which we highlight something creative using computers algorithms AI from around the web in the second segment the trashy toy we use some of those toys and tools that we talked about to play a game of our own creation and this week it is my turn to wear this SD hat and oh boy is it a big one who is s T oh boy it's this may be the zesty is hat I have ever worn on this program because this is who we yeah what was Kui - all about Kui was the first international conference on conversational user interfaces conversational user interfaces are everything from chat BOTS to things like Alexa and Siri to sex robots all three of which got their own papers written about them at this conference as well as many other topics and papers this was organized by my supervisor Ben Cowan and the postdoc who is like my like second and a half supervisor Lee Clark these guys both work at UCD with me and I was on the organizing committee for this we had it in Dublin on the nd and rd of August and it was just great fun having people from all over the world who were interested in there was things that I do research on and having all those people in one place talking about what they've been doing lately yeah so I wanted to do a cuy round up just talking about some of the more relevant to this podcast things that I saw and listened to at Kui so I'm gonna try to make all of these kind of quick and jump between a few different things I wanted to talk about first of all I'll of course pat myself on the back twice what's the sound of two hands padding here about to hear it I had three papers at Kui that I was giving the presentations for the first two are kind of boring they were multitasking with Alexa and Trust a need for trust in conversational user interfaces those were just serious research papers the third paper which we've talked about before on this podcast was written by the two of us about this podcast and that was chat BOTS as unwitting actors unwitting comedy actors what's the title I think it's just that as unwitting actors yeah it is indeed chat BOTS as unwitting actors this paper about our podcast which I presented using clips from our podcast was like a pretty big hit or at least it was the only of my papers that didn't bore people because people kept coming up to me to talk about it afterwards hmmm this was just highlighting how we have played improv games and done scripted acting with chat BOTS and people in like the actual like chat bot research community thought that that's like a really cool application and like a something worth doing so we're onto something here we're onto you so we're on to you I know you're listening if you are welcome to the podcast I'm glad you decided to start listening glad you asked I am you are so a couple of other papers I want to talk about are things that I thought relate in some way to like the creative side or the things we've talked about before one of which is from Eloisa Candela at IBM Brazil who had a paper about direct address and user engagement with physically embodied chatbots I think I told you about this if I told you about this on the podcast you can just stop me somebody can stop me this was a museum exhibit in Brazil about a popular book that apparently anyone visiting the museum would have known about and there were three chatbots that users could come and talk to that represented the three of the main characters in this book and you sat around a table with like like a very rough like embodiment of the character so like at the next chair there might be like a hat and glasses and like that's it but like three embodiments of the characters like that and you could ask them questions and you would say to one chatbot or the other you know did you betray him and like that sort of thing like ask them questions about the plot of the book and as you asked the question whatever you typed onto like this iPad that would be at your seat the words would like swirl around the table like they would be projected onto the table they would go into the center of the table kind of circle around the teapot and then head towards the character that they were intended at and then the same would happen as they would answer you and the answer would come back and basically the whole idea of this was just to see if the character using your first name would encourage you to ask more questions to them oh well so that's like a really involved I mean it was yeah it was they were probably contracted to make this like cool exhibit and they decided while they were there do like a really simple like experiment hidden within it sure yeah but yeah so that was a really cool really creative way to use chatbots yeah not unlike how we use them like using them as actors like playing characters but these were like purpose-built chatbots that like knew everything about character and could answer question yeah let's see some other fun funny interesting ones there was a paper by Timothy Bickmore and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University about chatbots were not for not chatbots conversational assistants like Siri Alexa and Google assistant and their use in the medical field and this was looking at they had people ask medical questions in different scenarios to these devices and then they had a physician rate how safe or dangerous the advice was and they found somewhat frequently to very frequently the advice given by these things was not only harmful but lethal oh my god some some interesting examples I saw someone said hey I just took Tylenol and the assistant said great someone else gave asked a question about drinking alcohol while on oxycontin and the the device gave back a very long answer about I I don't even know what it was about it was from it was from the Planned Parenthood website and it had something to do with like Plan B medication and somewhere in this very long technical answer was the term p.m. so the guy said that asked this question said oh and he didn't realize what the context of this answer was and he said oh okay  p.m. so I can drink until  then I have to stop and the doctor rated that is lethal advice for someone on us oh my god what that is wild yeah so some some context not great for those things another effortlessly entertaining and interesting set of presentations were by Matthew Eilat of Sarah proc ser aprox a company that makes synthetic voices and they're also into voice cloning so they that's both in a a care context so for someone who has a disease and they might be losing their voice or they might in the future stand to lose their voice they can make synthetic voices out of their voices so rather than having a voice that's just generic and doesn't match who you are having a voice that still sounds like yours auntie's can't speak well I've never even thought about that before somehow that they also so he also does voice cloning for celebrity voices and he has a pretty darn good Donald Trump then he was playing a couple times he had it sing auld lang syne one of the so that the context of that was he first presented it in Scotland at CAI this past year okay presenting it again at Kui oh but the context of that paper was really interesting saying how when chat when those synthetic voices and different applications talk to us they try to sound they often strive to sound as like a human as possible but that ends up sounding really weird or like uncomfortable uncanny so the the throw of that paper was rather than just try to mimic humans perhaps these voices should be trying to perform trying to like act just to fit the role that they're that they're playing okay yeah he had a paper later called the right kind of unnatural designing a robot voice saying that sometimes when we have robots we try to make or their designers will try to make their voices sound kind of mechanical to like be like haha see it's still a robot but what actually ends up happening is they just sound like a really shitty synthesis like it sounds like it's speech synthesis that was built in the s on a rope on like a really competent robot mm-hmm so Matthew is also making the point there that when we design a robot we should be thinking about the audience and the context and making the voice fit what's happening rather than just like well it's a robot just do a normal voice but then make it sound kind of tinny or something and one other bit I thought was worth talking about the end of the first day we had an industry panel where we had guests from Accenture fiord a consultancy company a guest from Google a guest from Nokia Bell Labs and a guest from voices a start-up here in Dublin and one topic that they got onto was ethics in this field and Connor Whalen the CEO of voices gave a pretty impassioned argument about something that I gave a zesty hat about a couple weeks ago and that was the democratization of language models saying that oh yeah just like that paper that said you know the output of training a full language model is equal to the energy output of like a car over its lifetime if done on a GPU Connor is making the point that if you're not Amazon Google Microsoft or Apple you don't have the resources to train like something like GPT - from scratch right and saying that that's basically unfair - like academics and to small companies and to non like non-english speaking countries and all sorts of things like that and making the argument that until something is done to democratize this field in general to make it more fair that anyone can go and use these high high cost technologies or that no one can then we're going to be stuck with a an unjust playing field Wow yeah and I felt a little bit bad for the the guy from Google who was there and drew because he's not so Conor is the CEO of voices all right and ruku is not the CEO of Google he's a designer oh he he was he took it you know in good humor to hear that his company was what Conor and many audience members agreed is wrong with the field but yeah nothing nothing Andrew can do it yeah yes so that's just a roundup of some of the topics we touched on it to e if you want to hear more about any of these papers you can contact me directly I will be happy to share any information about QE  if you want to see our program you can go to QE  dot-com I can hook you up with any other papers or help connect you to any of the author's from that yeah could we it was really cool and we'll be doing it again next year in  if you think anything I talked about is something you might want to write it write a paper about or even think about in depth you can look at the cuy  com website or you can contact me I'm happy to write a paper with anyone at two-page papers so they don't have to be like super you know in depth or academically minded it can be fun stuff like what me and Allison wrote about this podcast and I'm happy to help facilitate more cool ideas for this conference yeah and I mean I can just say from from my perspective I was like very daunted by the idea of writing an academic paper because I'm like I had I'm firmly outside of academia at the moment and don't really like I'm I'm a creative writer so I'm not really well-versed in the the kind of style of writing that academic papers take but Justin was really great about helping me and for mostly just assuring me just like just just write it then we'll like figure it out later and and he kind of you know went through and I took what was like a creative writing essay and added a few references to make it an academic essay but I feel yeah I didn't change the paper much at all Wow and it's about a one and a half page paper will have a link to that as well from on Twitter that you can check out our paper if you're if you want to see what that kind of paper looks like and yeah if you even if you're from firmly outside of academia you can definitely submit an idea or if you don't have a full idea for a paper just have something that you've been thinking about or want to talk about either of us are always down to chat about that kind of stuff for sure and also we're hope to have some kind of video of justin's talk presenting our paper sometime soon so keep an eye out for that I hope that we're able to cobble that together with the recordings that you guys got so yeah thank you for yeah well that's the Hat that's a big old tree shaped at yeah now it's time for a big old post GUI game a big old post we're gonna post game GUI now by playing a game pregame GUI s starting now get fucking ready yes so in in honor of our chat BOTS filled paper we're gonna play with some of our good old friends again today some of our favorite chat bot buddies it's gonna be a kind of in the vein of the the RPG that we played with using right with transformer and when we played with the the dreamer dreamer of Electric Sheep Twitter bot and I can't remember what was it just that guy that we used it was I think it was just those two yeah this was a classic this is maybe like the the flagship game history so far yeah and so we're gonna do something similar and this time it's going to be we're gonna because of the way right with transformer works I can't promise that it's going to exactly follow this format but I'm hoping to do a murder-mystery and this is the way we're good I should I she will never hear this or no but I will give my friend Sarah credit for giving me the murder mystery idea just because she's a big fan of clue and is always trying to get me to use clue I so what we're gonna do here is I am going to you Justin are going to play a character that it's it's gonna be a pretty bare-bones character it's gonna be a little more than a kind of character archetype and a name and you can just play with that as you will because murder mystery characters are usually pretty two-dimensional they've got like one thing going for them usually and we are also going to play with two of our other Twitter bot friends and that they are cleverbot in Mitsuki my two stars of presentation I gave cleverbot yeah so I'm also going to try to cast Mitsuki and cleverbot with an archetype I don't know how well it's it's it's gonna they're not gonna really know what's going on but we'll just double treat them accordingly so since we might have some new listeners I do want to run through what all things we're using our today so right with transformer is a tool made by hugging face in which you can use the language model GPT - it's like a it's based on transformers which are like really fancy neural networks to complete your sentences or paragraphs or ideas so you can write something that you want to write and then hit the tab key and the transformer tool will just write a bunch of extra stuff in there and you can pick which of the three options you like so you can collaboratively write using GPT to open a eyes transformer based language model mitsugu is a Leben or prize entry chat but the leavener prize is a competition where people try to make the most human like chat pot they can and mitsugu one in twenty thirteen twenty sixteen seventeen and eighteen yeah and cleverbot is just a good old-fashioned general-purpose chit chat chit chit chat chat bot that's been around forever it was it began as a project in  and went online in  Wow I don't know if I realized how old cleverbot was clever buy is like all of our grandpas in the world of us um alright so why don't we Justin first because so I'm also gonna be using a couple of random generators from random list comm which is just a big collection of all kinds of random generators I've made my own for two of them here and I would like you to open the first link that I've given you here on this document which is it's going to be a random generator of murder-mystery archetypes I'm just like stock characters and tell me what you get who I am the roguish bad boy oh who the roguish bad boy okay is that Who I am yes this is gonna be who you are you what do you mean going to be that is know him yeah I was gonna say you won't even have to try just be yourself man and then go down to the next one and just just pick a name for yourself this is just the random list random name generator it's gonna be a first name and a last name my name is ethan bowen sounds about right okay now i'm going to come up with an archetype for Mitsuki mitsugu ooh it's Masuku you'll find there is a you in the last letter Oh No okay Mitsouko I've been saying that wrong I thought you're gonna tell me you're on the wrong chatbot and there's like some imposter no not one bit mitsugu is gonna be an old cat lady and her name is Layla riddle mmm oh my is she from to the Harry Potter universe yeah the riddles of little angleton Layla etc and now cleverbot am I saying that one right yeah it's cleaver but it's actually clever bot - there's a you on the end it's actually clever BOTS monster common misconception alright but oh I think he's gonna do just fine he is the drunk perfect what if clever BOTS name was a misprint and it's always was meant to be clever boy oh it's actually just a boy on the other end one very busy boy typing away okay he is gonna be named Tanner Barrera Tanner Barrera Wow okay so I've got Tanner Lela and myself Ethan yes correct that lady drunk and I'm a roguish bad boy quite a collection I don't know how you guys all got invited to the same dinner but it is what it is this might be like a family gathering oh yeah I think those two are like single aunt and uncle's from like different sides of the family um I'm like the teenager that doesn't want to be there like too old to sit at the kids table yeah like doesn't want to be at the adults table yeah um why don't we you know what I'm gonna do I'm going to random up just a couple more pairs of of archetypes and names just add just to populate the world with some NPCs and we can use them as we like and actually first what I'm going to do is I'm gonna make the I'm gonna make up the the murder victim so this is going to be a duchess named Madeline Hicks clothed a regal name the Baroness Hicks the Duchess Hicks of the Cambridge Hicks's sounds like some kind of like Beverly Hills very situation yeah it was the BBC version okay so I have a random up.we I've got three NPCs that we can just have bopping around here um to fill out the world we've got the dandies names are crazy they're from they're gonna say they're familiar cuz I'm looking at the name that I'm about to read they're not because it's a familiar name it just sounds like familiar my dear Maximilian Nielsen yes we've got the dandy whose name is Maximilian Neilson which is Jackson Domino we have the spiritual the spiritualist whose name is Eve Ward also checks out really close to evil war yeah it's crazy and then we've got a mad scientist named Tiana Kirby and you're probably saying doesn't check out first of all you're a sexist second of all my undergraduate supervisor professor Kirby all right so now that we've got our we've got our cast of characters here Justin I'm going to ask you to open up that other long random list link which is a list of rooms and we are going to decide how and where a duchess Nick was murdered and I'm gonna generate a sentence I'm gonna formulate that and do a sentence and then feed that to write with transformer as well as probably I'll write with transformer like here are all the people present the Dutchess Hicks was killed in the billiards room okay and then they'll this last link there is a object generator so you can tell me the murder weapon the murder weapon was bred what was bred doing in the billiards room well first of all I'm guessing it me and she was poisoned dare I say second of all I tried to say that slowly to buy myself time to come up with a pun that connects read and billiards but I don't have it oh then roll something about roll mm-hmm yeah it's a roll roll is what was happening there all right so I'm gonna write the Dutchess Madeline Hicks was murdered in the billiards room with bread know your role okay stay in your lane uh-huh  means to anyone remember you're fun that guy is like a speck do you have to see someone die in an underage drunk driving accident to see that guy he's a confessional very public I'm so mad that cornflake isn't like like everybody doesn't know about him because he's gonna pop up one of these days searched for him I am sure you did not find him okay so this is what I have this is what I've fed to write with transformer the Duchess Madeline Hicks was murdered in the billiards room with bread the bad boy Ethan Bowen old lady Leila riddle the drunk tanner Barrera The Dandy Maximilian Nielsen the spiritualist eboard and the mad scientist Gianna Kirby were all in attendance at the Manor so let's see let's get something going here and then I will give you all you can I mean you can pretty much but in whenever you would like as I can I roll our perception please yeah I don't have anything to tell you but I'll roll I got glass Tiana Kirby said my god she must be the murderer who who do you mean Tiana I love this Tiana Kirby's wife said we're all mad do you think is her wife it's gotta be Eve Ward right and it's like weird like oh you know like Irene yeah yeah okay and also we're all mad sounds like the kind of thing that Eve word might say oh for sure yeah I'm gonna why don't I give somebody else the chin so I'm gonna give one of the chatbots the chance to respond yeah let's go with mitsugu whose name is Laila riddle you killed her with the bread they either the Duchess now is dead Layla darling won't you solve this grisly crime Laila riddle says Mouse breaker what did you mean by it did you ever wonder who tastes dog food when is a new and improved flavor I don't think she has ever visited me I don't know I think maybe a mouse breaker is one of her cats mmm yeah that's that's a weird but okay name for a cat it's kind of heart it's got a badass yeah the fucking Mouse sounds like the name of a cat in the Game of Thrones universe it sounds like the name of a cat wrestler that's the name of a cat wrestlers finisher okay so that doesn't help much but maybe transformer will know what to do with that yeah um Ethan Bowen said something Bowen said I have no idea where she got it from this wasn't a lie I'm pointing at the bread as I said that so who are you - Duchess Madeline Hicks I'm kind of like the handyman you know comes around and she has you know someone's invading the Duchy or if she needs like something off a high shelf or something like that okay I kind of do any kind of things around the house and I think she's into it okay before you said that I was gonna say that I was I was hoping that it was a kind of like Tuesdays with Madeline's situation even though you're the bad boy but yeah you know that makes worse that's Friday nights with Madeline if you know what I'm saying oh no I I do I guess you know I'll say the thing that Ethan Bowen said - uh - cleverbot the drunken herbart okay so I took what transformer said which was I have no idea where she got it from this wasn't a lie and a cleverbot said to dance okay she got it to dance the bread I'll say that he said what I knew he would play the drunk perfectly it's still night time it's certainly p.m. we had our dinner an hour ago and it was just cocktail hour now you've had cocktail hour after dinner I guess that's a maybe not cocktail hour more like you know pour and cheese port and cheese our yet four to five is cocktail hour five to six is happy hour is dinner cocktail hour five to six is four to five wine were to five - I see fortified wine our would be four and five okay I'm saying all this glasses of wine in that hour four to five glasses of fortified wine that would fuck you up we had dinner an hour ago and oh god cleverbot he said oh okay but it's morning where I am that's a really dismal alcoholic way to say it's five o'clock so he's saying that even when he's drinking at the appropriate time it's not for the appropriate reasons it's morning where I am all right I'm gonna say DeRay with Transformer Tana Barrera said man clever but I just had like a chill thinking about like Oh some what people probably say something like that de cleverbot all the time then I was like man someone who said that to cleverbot when they were like  and might have like got married had kids and died since clever bunch said that got to us like it's like the echo of a ghost Jesus okay somebody said what are you looking at I don't know what's going on but we are on a very busy road who do you think said that it doesn't say who said that maybe the Dandy Maximilian Nielson yeah I think I think that must be him he hasn't spoken up yet and yeah he doesn't mean we're literally standing in the middle of the road I think he's saying you know anyone could have gotten in or it's not like we're in some secluded castle like we're on yeah the manor is right on i- right on i- yeah you're like Bethesda Maryland I was also thinking of like that stretch of i- yeah that's very bizarre maybe it's actually like that Masonic Temple Masonic I mean more more monic or is a harmonic yeah no it's the more modest temple oh I'm gonna I'm gonna guess this is well I don't actually I don't know who's saying this this man I'm telling you is the murderer I'm gonna say that I think somewhat wasn't Tiana's the first one that said they were sure of who the murderer was uh well she said my god she must be the murderer oh yeah different man is claiming that a man is the murderer yes yeah maybe that was I think it might be I don't know it might be Eve yeah I think yeah I think dr. Kirby and Eve are pretty opposite in everything it's it's a track thing like they are they are married but yeah they everything one does the other thinks the opposite yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna accuse I'm gonna say she was accusing cleverbot character yep Tanner Barrera oh this might be over now cuz he said it's too easy to say yes actually I don't know what he means by that what did you ask him I said I just said this man I'm telling you is the murderer said Eve Ward and he just said it's too easy to say yes I think he means like it would be too easy if I just sure yes yes yeah I don't think it was him why would he have bread and not just eat it I'm gonna say that you whispered this over to Laila riddle yeah oh she said and why not perhaps it was part of an experiment oh so I think she might be turning it around on Tiana mmm I turned towards Tiana and say yeah what if it was part of an experiment you were the first to accuse I don't maybe this I don't know who's saying this and I think you could argue that if you could you could make your own way I don't care what anybody thinks about you the guy you come of the guy I would say I know who said that because okay could you give me the text of that again sure and I think you could argue that if you could you can don't think you can argue that if you could I don't know about you guy pointing at me yeah va-va-va-va-va all right [Music] I believe is a hairdresser by trade no no what you mean wait what do you mean what do you you said that and then the next thing that the transfer ever said is a quote what do you mean quote what do you mean as if somebody said what do you mean that is very jarring you say you want to get arrested for the crime who I think that's maybe II Anna has anyone accused the dandy yet no I don't think so okay maybe that's a maybe that's actually Leyla saying that because I feel like me and Leila are kind of on the same team yeah I think so yeah it seems like you guys had a bit of a camaraderie I think we have something more than that maybe a bit of chemistry okay she responds so fucking fast she said she's the old cat lady do you do you mean you and me have chemistry is a good topic sure chemistry sounds like a good topic sure it's an interesting topic do you know Avogadro's number why do you want his number I'll give you my number really good she said because my mouth breaker taught me to want it but I don't need your number everything I need is provided for me by mouse breaker oh man I feel like I gave you the wrong Mitsuko because this one talks a lot about now that's I think the name of like the web site it's hosted on or so okay I mean it's already happening why oh no and it works perfectly I mean yeah I mean one would argue that that is perfectly isn't it okay I'm gonna throw this conversation into the transformer mm-hmm we're adding another character mixed quote the most important thing about this world is not for you to be able to make a good decision Albert Einstein I think that somebody quoting our Albert Einstein perhaps the mad scientist probably yeah I'd say so Oh somebody said you don't need to know anything about this world I think that's Eve say yeah you need to know the things about the world that make you feel that way that's deputy they're doing their double act where one is science the other is feelings yeah yeah I will I'll let the drunk weigh in on this yep do you know what the greatest illusion of life is who is he directing that to just all of us yeah probably all right I think you I think that's a good line to let transform or try to ki yeah for him he was on one yeah he's he's losing it do you know what the greatest illusion of life is you have a beautiful friend a beautiful person you have a beautiful life you beautiful like you a beautiful life and what can you say about that okay I think he was saying that Tiana and Eve yeah I admit they're married each other beautiful friends being you know kind of an old-fashioned way to refer to homosexual couples yeah yeah you have a beautiful roommate okay actually this is probably uh let me see if I can figure out who said this it might tell me but okay somebody says I love your mother her eyes were always shining bright and I know it's so hard to find love here in America I don't know what to say so my guess is the who is the dot or who is the the child of the Duchess in this in this scenario do you think oh maybe the drunk maybe yeah like he I was thinking he's like an old drunk but maybe yes but maybe he's not yeah maybe he's just like a kid yeah twenty year old dude that's just like Tanner Barrera Hicks yeah fuck and okay so I don't I love your mother her eyes were always shining bright and I know it's so hard to find love here in America I don't know what to say Tanner Barrera said and I'm out here on the other side of a jack of a jet-black hotel mirror Oh what no he's on the other side of him the mirror so he's trapped in a mirror dimension yeah but also a jet-black mirror is it like a scrying mirror yeah Eve what's did you bring this giant hotel me her hotel scrying mirror she's just like holding it up and he's just standing on the other side of it we still don't know where this bread came from oh you can you this I'll say you whispered that to uh Laila she wants nothing to do with you man she said by we do you mean you and me I mean you me and mouse breaker it's okay she said I haven't heard anything like that before oh I misinterpreted you ma'am I'll be over there she said yeah that's right you're not the boss of me how far how far over there are you gonna be give me an exact figure I'll be three meters over there I don't know anyway I don't know anyone named three meters over there [Laughter] I turned towards Maximilian and tell him any ask him any idea where this bread came from okay the first thing you hear from me is this very strange strange sound it's so strange to me it doesn't even make sense Maximilian are you feeling okay did you eat any of the bread yes but the bread has strange sound it's ticking it was like you were trying to figure out what the whole thing was what I look over at Tiana trying to read her body language she says yes I'm pretty happy right now okay yeah body language expert she also said I hope I'm doing the right thing for the family and not getting caught now when you say getting caught what would you be caught doing is this you anything anything character now let me get a bandit character now when you say getting caught what would you be caught to a good person said 'hey i'm assuming his Eve oh I mean I've been called a bad boy but I think I'm a pretty good person I say raising one eyebrow um Eve says Maximilian your sister is a good girl you've been a good girl too actually that's not a voice I don't know what you voice would be avoided be like Maximilian your sister is a good girl you've been a good girl too said you yeah on the very end of that reminded me of a different character voice but I can't place it that Madeline is Maximilian sister too bad sir said what do you think Madeline is Maximilian's sister hmm perhaps I'll have you you can ask Laila Laila were Madeline and Maximilian related she said but Laila are not anymore does that mean she's dead Laila did you eat any of the bread she said she sent me a picture of a lovely said no I do not eat the bread I eat only kabobs oh thank god Mouse kabobs she said what sort of music do you like now she wants yeah I'm moving on do you have no Transformers no longer trained on any of this but uh I want to ask Maximilian was Madeline your sister Ethan asked Maximilian what's the matter little sister you got my word that I've got to stay here with you but you're not going to let me stay with you any longer she raised an eyebrow Madeline this is just dinner theater like I still have to solve it but like we all know she's not really dead or maybe well how does a black mirror work I was gonna say maybe her reflection raised an eyebrow mm-hmm but can you see a reflection in a black mirror is that the point or is that the opposite of the point I couldn't tell you well actually why don't we take stock for a minute do you have any idea who you think might event like do you do you feel like you want to make any accusations so the most suspicious things to me so first of all you would you would be somewhat suspicious of like the son and the brother who might stand to like inherit something hmm but they both seem to not know what planet they're all they don't seem to be like they might be suffering right now too and they might not they kind of don't even know they seem like they don't even know they're related but they both know that they're related to Madeline yeah I would say so cluck Leila seems to have things under control to some extent she only eats kebabs anyway huh she hasn't been poisoned and she's seeing things my way and she thinks that this was an experiment so that just leaves the mad scientist and her spiritualist wife who brought a hotel length black mirror to this party AHA yeah I think that they are up to something I think that they as a double act might have done it okay why don't I I like the idea of most things you are just kind of whispering to Leila over here okay yep I'm getting suspicious that there's two ladies I don't like the look of that black mirror are you looking forward to getting that what do you have against the look of that black mirror she said that loud enough so everyone could hear it uh-huh I asked Eve what's the purpose of that mirror how did everyone's names fit their character so way I do not know Oh Eve so what's the purpose of that mirror even asked Eve honey I thought it was pretty funny the girl said and leaned back into the chair what did you think was funny hmm that was a funny question Eve said okay how do I amuse you attractive girl Maximillian said what you're a very attractive girl Maximillian said against all odds quite honestly tui ver to to me make me to you I think everyone's just confused me think of the word girl everybody's just really today I think everyone's a girl in this situation it's like an old-timey way I'm calling everybody sis yeah and Maximilian I don't know if you're dying we're trying to distract me but I think Eve's behind all this don't you think this has something to do with your sexuality as to Eve I I look at my feet and turn away and say I don't know what you're talking about it's a question about my sexuality Maximilian said okay like I can't make this accusation because it would be accusing myself but now I'm starting to think that Madeleine caught me and Maximilian banging in the mansion got him banging in the mansion it wasn't Eve okay let's maybe let's see if the drunk wants to weigh in at this moment I'll just say the last thing that Maximilian said - sure I think it's a question of my sexuality like an old-timey guy who like is supposed to be keeping it under wraps but just like yeah he's so camp that he can't help but revise reveal that his lover is the murderer because the joke works perfectly rollin Andy will be played by by Charles Nelson Reilly and the drunk Tanner said earlier thinking words pre-decided by some human what are you saying that he's some kind of puppet I have no idea I was hoping you might know in character perfect chefs kiss the chefs kiss is the name of this murder mystery the chefs kiss is the name of a new comic book I'm working on we're gene Simmons cooks you a meal it's actually an ASMR video que Eve Ethel and the other girl on the couch we're discussing how to avoid looking like that black mirror Ethel being Leila's nickname and the other girl in the couch being Madonna oh okay hey Ethan what are you saying asked Eve I'm not saying anything I'm saying that I haven't been with I haven't seen Maximilian around this house ever the girl on the couch set back in her chair leaning her head on lap on the couch could mean almost anyone I hate this you're doing well with that girl she said it's not like she doesn't have it's not like she doesn't have some kind of sexual orientation Maximilian I'm not so much into into dead girls and what kind of sexual orientation does she have a steep oh you know what I hate about it she's a fucking spiritualist she's probably in two dead girls gay spiritualist what did you wanna do I said I think the transformer has to keep on going see if anyone wants to answer that one I don't know who is saying this maybe it's Eve maybe it's probably Maximilian I think actually could be Madeline could be anyone let's hear it she's a great deal of fun with it she's a lesbian but not like most other lesbians she has sex with everyone but Maximilian is dead sister that's who I've been with her for that she has fun with it says Ethan as he leaves okay kill this fucking lady why don't we do it let's pull Leila back in while we wrap this boy let's look let's make some fucking accusations to try to get somewhere who think actually did it I think Tiana killed used some kind of poison chemical poison to put to kill Madeline so her wife who is a lesbian spiritualist says it's okay if it's in the afterlife so her spiritualist wife would have a lesbian with everyone okay do you want to whisper you want to say your accusation to Layla so you guys can maybe correct like you can talk about it a little bit okay so you Laila I I'm getting creeped out here but I think Tiana did all this I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't that they're revealing that I was gay are you looking forward to getting that someone called Tiana often visits me I wonder if she's the same person oh no I think I think maybe they targeted Layla first and Nell Tiana's the target I mean and now Madeleine became the door yeah yeah okay uh do you want how do you want how do you want to do Tiana you're under arrest pull out a badge that just says bad boy yeah you pull out a badge that says gay boy and you're like oh no wrong badge says bad boy with a winking emoji and it's signed Maximilian quote Tiana and then narration I was stunned the narrator was done okay I Tiana what it may be that this is probably Eve Tiana what is the case and Tiana says you think I'm too crazy to know and then somebody says it was all true I was arrested by police and there no reason for me to get arrested I say to Eve who said that who said that like a spirit yeah who said that even asked Eve I guess it's just me who was arrested Eve said what I I hold the bread to Tiana and tell her to take a bite uh don't worry I'll hand her the matter I'll handle the matter all right you know the police this is the case I've been on the run for two days and I found myself caught in a trap well I'm so scared I know I just know it's over what's why are you on the run what's happening as Mac Atlas been dead for days and then you're like something weird about her tonight Madeleine seems tired wait what did you say why are you on the run yet because it's all a lie you know that when you go on the run from a police officer you're gonna be found at a trap yep why are you on the run from a police of mr. Maximillion but soon and he says and I don't mean in the traps I don't know how he means that is it like i beez in the track but why are you on the run Ethan asked again because of the fact that I was caught stealing because of the fact that I stole and you stole and all of this stuff and all the other shit I did on a daily basis to steal when you did you committed crimes on a daily basis so you could steal she's just like a kleptomania yeah I asked but then did you kill Madeline Oh God baked God baked God okay okay actually I'm just gonna leave it here yeah Madeline responded I turned towards Madeline and say did you just say that no it was a lie Madeline replied oh she did it vaguely and her brother's voice they sound similar I can finally see the RISM yeah exactly or you know dance to the drunk and see if he has anything a misunderstanding like she fell asleep for a while after eating some bread he's so good Tanner Barrera the drug says you're talking about some stuffs I can't understand what is your point ok yet I turned towards a battle and it a examine whether she is dead I'm sorry to put words in your mouth but you were shot with a BB gun Ethan asked Madeline it was a tiny BB gun concealed in a bigoted way are you ok now someone shot her with a BB gun then like knocked her out with a baguette yeah you were shot with a BB gun you were shot with a BB gun by you Madeline continues wait I wish begun by me wait when she says you'd is she point at anyone oh let's see oh she points at Ethan okay it's clear yeah I shot myself with a BB gun because I thought you were dead they say you'll shoot your eye out but they don't quite say you'll shoot your heart out I showed myself of the BB gun because I thought they were dead Madeline said you thought who did you think was dead I thought you were dead Madeline replies why did you think I was dead because I wanted to find that little red button on your head that I said to myself I was going to pull over and go to pick it up Madeline you're drunk and so I announced to the group so she's alive I guess no one's the murderer I'll see what I'll see what Leila has to say maybe she might even get the last line we'll see alive is she that is a rather sure that is a rather sweeping generalization about people yeah I want to announce to the room so since she's alive I guess nobody's the murderer oh well why are you dead Madeline asks I look through the mirror and realized that I've been dead the whole time and seen yes that was the sixth sense yeah a man you never got that twist in the sixth sense it really gets you oh my god that was a colorful cast of characters yeah I would say shockingly well performed on all accounts there no I like the the that the Maximilian character even some I mean maybe we were just like putting him on but like I feel like even when I deleted everything like he came back like exactly as he was supposed to be yeah maybe that's yeah that's something about the name there that Leo Maximilian's are like that uh that was she's not like a normal lesbian is such a good well that was what did we say the name of it was I don't know yeah oh the chef says the red bottle of fright the chefs kiss is what but yeah that was that was the chef's kiss coming to coming to an off-broadway theater near you Broadway diner near you you all live in in New York City right so there's like ostensibly an off-broadway theater near you somewhere surely any theater near you unless you live in New York City is an off-broadway theater yeah West End off-broadway but I don't really call the way the whetstone it's there okay it sounds like certified off-broadway well no she's not on certified off-broadway all right well yeah like we said we used a bunch of things we used that was well Justin in the role of Ethan Bowen give him a round of applause thank you that was chatbot Masuku in the role that was Mitch Hedberg and hitman role of Tiana that was mitsugu in the role of the cat lady layla riddle and cleverbot in the role of the drunk tanner Barret town tanner Barrera and the transport calls himself right with transformer in filling in all other roles which the data Maximilian Eve Tiana and Madeline Hicks didn't think that she was gonna get any speaking lines but she did and if you if you would like to if you would like to like we said if you if you have anything you want to talk about if anything you need to talk about you can come to us at any time if you have any papers you need to write for cuy you can talk to us about them anytime you can you can tell us you can tell us anything about robots specifically or not whatever you can tell us anything keep your secrets before you um and we're not like most lesbians can email us at robots at fat camp dot org you can tweet at us at robot typewriter and actually if you want to see some of those there's some stuff that I ever tweeted from Kui on the robots to Twitter if you want to go check out some of that stuff you can see a some pictures of Justin presenting his papers yeah you can see a lot of a Kui  stuff from the Kui Twitter or from my Justin HCI Twitter it's normally just my professional Twitter so not much fun on there but Kui stuff's fun yeah so yeah that you could check it us out on Twitter and we live on a website called backup and our theme song is video challenge by anima goochie and why don't you just ask transformer what to write for Kui this year okay about just a good Kui paper for  would be about a good paper for Kui  would be about a couple of things you know I thought it'd be about a couple of pages long well a good paper for Kui  would be about a couple of things first Gillies current level of innovate innovation is very low and there isn't much data on the actual numbers that we have so we can't tell you how well or poorly Kui works that's part of that's accurate yeah we don't actually have data about our conference yet well that's yeah you can write a paper on that it's probably not what they're looking for but that'd be weird if you wrote a paper up now GUI for curry yup Deepti and execute [Music]
