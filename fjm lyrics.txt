Fun times in Babylon
That's what I'm counting on
Before the dam goes up at the foot of the sea
Before the new wing of the prison ribbon ceremony
Before the star of the morning comes looking for me

I would like to abuse my lungs
Smoke everything in sight with every girl I've ever loved
Ride around the wreckage on a horse knee-deep in blood
Look out Hollywood, here I come

Fun times in Babylon
Mama they've just begun
Before they put me to work in a government camp
Before they do my face up like a corpse and say "get up and dance"
Before the beast comes looking for last year's rent

I would like to abuse my lungs
Smoke everything in sight with every girl I've ever loved
Ride around my wreckage on a horse knee-deep in blood
Look out Hollywood, here I come
Look out Hollywood, here I come
Look out Hollywood, here I come
Oh, pour me another drink
And punch me in the face
You can call me Nancy
Every man wears a symbol
And I know I have mine
I've got my right hand stamped
In the concentration camp
Where my organs scream, "Slow down, man!"

How was I to know?
Milk and honey flow
Just a couple states below

Oh, hook me up to the tank
And roll me to the door
I'm going where my body leads me
I can fend for myself
With what looks I have left
I'll put away a few
And pretty soon
I'll be breaking things like Howard Hughes

How was I to know?
Milk and honey flow
Just a couple states below

Ooh, give me how it was
A place under the sun
Before the devil made me run
Run boy, run boy
Jesus Christ, girl
What are people gonna think?
When I show up to one of several funerals
I've attended for Grandpa this week

With you
With me
But someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig

Jesus Christ, girl
It hasn't been long so it seems
Since I was picking out an island and a tomb for you
At the Hollywood Cemetery

You kiss
On me
But we should let this dead guy sleep
We should let this dead guy sleep

Jesus Christ, girl
I laid up for hours in a daze
Retracing the expanse of your American back
With Adderall and weed in my veins

You came
I think?
'Cause the marble made my cheeks look pink
But I'm unsure of so many things

But someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig
I ran down the road
Pants down to my knees
Screaming, "Please come help me
That Canadian shaman gave a little too much to me!"

And I'm writing a novel
'Cause it's never been done before

First house that I saw
I wrote, "House" up on the door
And told the people who lived there they had to get out
"'Cause my reality is realer than yours"

And there's no time in the present
And there's a black dog on the bed

I went to the backyard
To burn my only clothes
And the dog ran out and said
"You can't turn nothing into nothingness with me no more"

Well I'm no doctor
But that monkey might be right
And if he is
I'll be walking him my whole life

I rode to Malibu
On a dune buggy with Neil
He said, "You're gonna have to drown me down on the beach
If you ever want to write 'the real'."

And I said "I'm sorry.
Young man what is your name again?"

Now everywhere I go
In West Hollywood
It's filled with people pretending they don't see the actress
And the actress wishing that they could

We could do ayahuasca
Baby, if I wasn't holding all these drinks

Something 'bout the way
Violet whips her hair
That makes me empty my pockets on the corner to corner
Bumming twenties as if I was the mayor

I don't need any new friends, Mama
But I could really use something to do
So if you're up for it sometimes
I swear you wouldn't have to be my muse

Heidegger and Sartre
Drinking poppy tea
I could've sworn last night I passed out in my van
And now these guys are pouring one for me

I'll never leave the canyon
'Cause I'm surrounded on all sides
By people writing novels
And living on amusement rides
Everyone's riding on the rolling tide
Their hearts are heavy and the sea is wide
I'll never make it to the other side
Friends of mine

O I long to feel your arms around me
O I long to feel your arms around me

O my love
O my love
Ooh
Ooh

No crickets, no creatures are a stirring
On the last night of the Chinese year
I need a warm hand over the water
Ever since I lost mine in the fireworks disaster

Now I lay up wide awake
Gonna take my life
Gonna take my life back one day

Now I'm watching you changing the mirror
And I'm unable to move
When all my girlfriends appear in the doorway
I don't know how they got here
I don't know what to say about this

And they all go that way
Gonna take my life
Gonna take my life back one day
When I heard the ladiesman was dead
I saw the rolling stone stop moving
Saw my ancient hero on the Sunset Strip
He left behind a legacy of ruin

Now painted ladies want to hold my gun
Wonder if the whole time if I'd been acting
When I sang "Moon River" in that silent film
Had I really made a sound when they called action

I swear that man was womankind's first husband
They all died in a line to save him
I'm a steady hand, I'm a Dodger's fan
I'm a leading brand, I'm a one night stand
I'm a ladiesman

Only son of a ladiesman
Only son of a ladiesman

Couldn't see his used-up body at the funeral
By virtue of the flailing of his conquests
They tied down his casket with the garter belt
Each troubled heart was beating in a sequined dress

Someone must console these lonesome daughters
No written word or ballad will appease them
Cowboy and the cop shot down the ladiesman
The humid nights in L.A. are now silent
I swear that man was womankind's first husband

Only son of the ladiesman
Only son of the ladiesman
Only son of the ladiesman
Born the daughter of a comedian
Middle of the 80s
Someone turn that awful mouth-breathing down
Or else

Sally Hatchet lives in a hole in the ground
The longer it keeps raining, the more she has to struggle
To maintain a wonderful time
Oh yeah

Oh wanna love it up without me
I've got smoke in my lungs
And a past life in the trunk
Oh

Could he rattle by the way that she
Empties a few clips out
Do I have a choice now?
Point that thing away from me
Lady, oh


If you see a flaming sword in your dreams at night
And feel inspired to assign me up to the front line
Well give the order
You'll storm the border without me

If they tell you you're a genius but you need some proof
Ask anybody on the payroll to go out with you
If they avoid ya
Then they'll award ya definitely

Nobody that's around just seems to get it right
How hard is it to follow just a few guidelines
And smile while you do it

If you want a page written 'bout you in the book
But you need a food tester 'cause you cursed the cook
I'll take some wine
But you can dine without me

Without me
Who would let you play God
And make-believe that all the blasphemy
Is coming only from me?

If you're bound for the throne but the king won't die
I can occupy the queen but that's for her and I
I can do her
And you'll be ruler without me

Yeah, you can do it
But you can do it without me
Oh, oh

Try not to think so much about
The truly staggering amount
Of oil that it takes to make a record
All the shipping, the vinyl
The cellophane lining, the high gloss
The tape and the gear

Try not to become too consumed
With what's a criminal volume
Of oil that it takes to paint a portrait
The acrylic, the varnish
Aluminum tubes filled with latex
The solvents and dye, oh

Let's just call this what it is
The jealous side of mankind's death wish
When it's my time to go
Gonna leave behind things that won't decompose

Try not to dwell so much upon
How it won't be so very long
From now that they laugh at us for selling
A bunch of fifteen year olds made from dinosaur bones singing, "Oh yeah"
Again and again
Right up to the end

Let's just call this what it is
The jealous side of mankind's death wish
When it's my time to go
Gonna leave behind things that won't decompose, oh

I'll just call this what it is
My vanity gone wild with my crisis
One day this all will repeat
I sure hope they make something useful out of me
Well you took me to the movies
You took me to the dance
You took me to your warehouse
Tied up in the back of your van
You said, "Whip it out." and I started to shout
"I'm in love with the woman again!"

Well you took me to your office
We went to meet your folks
We went out to the garden shed
Where I took off all my clothes
And I was terrified by the look in your eyes
But there's a lot to loving I don't know

Well you took me to the ceremony
To sweat out all my fear
You came across the cosmic serpent
With pants rolling into his hair
If he's my spirit guide, I'm gonna stay inside
I'm never sleeping in a teepee again

No no
No no no no no
Doo doo doo doo

Well you asked me where I came from
In the middle of round ten
I thanked you for the compliment
Before you clarified what you meant
You said, "What the hell are you doing here?
There's a crawler in my apartment."

Trout fishing in America
Baby go and buy a pole
But by the time I got around to reading the book
I was a celebrated deep sea pro
Was drinking Greyhounds way below the ground
On my very own TV show

Well we went to get some work done
So our faces finally matched
The doctor took one look at me
And took a skin graft out of my ass
If this is what it takes to take you one date
I'm gonna put my mammoth behind glass
If I make it out alive from Hollywood and Vine
I'll build a cabin up in the Northwest

No no
No no no no no
Doo doo doo doo
Oh, honeybear, honeybear, honeybear Ooh-ooh
Mascara blood
Ash and cum
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love

Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear Ooh-ooh
Fuck the world damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way

But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I want to watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say
In I-told-you-so voice
"It's just how we expected."

Everything is doomed, and nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear Ooh-Ooh Ooh-Ooh
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear Ooh-Ooh

You're bent over the altar
And the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door
Are probably conceiving a Damian

Don't they see the darkness rising?
Good luck figuring oblivion
We're getting out now while we can

You're welcome boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

But everything is fine
Don't give into despair
Cause I love you, honeybear
Emma eats bread and butter
Like a queen would have ostrich and cobra wine
We’ll have satanic Christmas Eve
And play piano in the chateau lobby

I’ve never done this
Baby, be gentle
It’s my first time
I’ve got you inside
People are boring
But you’re something else completely
Damn, let’s take our chances

I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian

I’ve never thought that
Ever thought that once
In my whole life
You are my first time
People are boring
But you’re something else I can’t explain
You take my last name

First time, you let me stay the night despite your own rules
You took off early to go cheat your way through film school
You left a note in your perfect script: "Stay as long as you want"
I haven’t left your bed since

I haven’t hated all the same things
As somebody else
Since I remember
What’s going on for?
What are you doing with your whole life?
How about forever?
Oh, I just love the kind of woman who can walk over a man
I mean like a god damn marching band
She says, like literally, music is the air she breathes
And the malaprops make me want to fucking scream
I wonder if she even knows what that word means
Well, it's literally not that

Of the few main things I hate about her, one's her petty, vogue ideas
Someone's been told too many times they're beyond their years
By every half-wit of distinction she keeps around
And now every insufferable convo
Features her patiently explaining the cosmos
Of which she's in the middle

Oh my God, I swear this never happens
Lately, I can't stop the wheels from spinning
I feel so unconvincing
When I fumble with your buttons

She blames her excess on my influence but gladly Hoovers all my drugs
I found her naked with the best friend in the tub
We sang "Silent Night" in three parts which was fun
Til she said that she sounds just like Sarah Vaughan
I hate that soulful affectation white girls put on
Why don't you move to the Delta?
I obliged later on when you begged me to choke ya

Julian
He's gonna take my files

Every woman that I've slept with
Every friendship I've neglected
Didn't call when grandma died
I spend my money getting drunk and high
I've done things unprotected
Proceeded to drive home wasted
Bought things to win over siblings
I've said awful things, such awful things

And now
Now it's out
And now
Now it's out

Julian
He's gonna take my files

Telling people jokes to shut them up
Resenting people that I love
Sleep in 'til two then doin' shit
Just stay in bed and later lie 'bout it
Obsessing over greying hair
Knowing just what people wanna hear
Binging on unearned attention
I've said awful things, such awful things

And now
Now it's out
And now
Now it's out

I came by at seven in the morning
Seven in the morning, seven in the morning
I came by at seven in the morning
I said, "Baby, I'm finally succumbing"
Said something dumb like "I'm tired of running
Tired of running, tired of running"
Let's put a baby in the oven
Wouldn't I make the ideal husband?

How many people rise and say
"My brain's so awfully glad to be here
For yet another mindless day"?

I've got all morning to obsessively accrue
A small nation of meaningful objects
And they've got to represent me too

By this afternoon, I'll live in debt
By tomorrow, be replaced by children

How many people rise and think
"Oh good, the stranger's body's still here
Our arrangement hasn't changed?"

Now I've got a lifetime to consider all the ways
I've grown more disappointing to you
As my beauty warps and fades
I suspect you feel the same
When I was young, I dreamt of a passionate obligation to a roommate

Is this the part where I get all I ever wanted?
Who said that?
Can I get my money back?

Just a little bored in the USA
Oh, just a little bored in the USA
Save me, white Jesus
Bored in the USA
Oh, they gave me a useless education
And a subprime loan
On a craftsman home
Keep my prescriptions filled
And now I can't get off
But I can kind of deal
Oh, with being bored in the USA
Oh, just a little bored in the USA
Save me, President Jesus
I'm bored in the USA
How did it happen?
Bored in the USA
Living it up
Have it all
Pull more women than any two men or train can haul
But my baby, she does something way more impressive than the Georgia Crawl
She blackens pages like a Russian romantic
Gets down more often than a blowup doll

Why the long face, Blondie? I'm already taken
Sorry
I may act like a lunatic
You think I'm fucking crazy, you're mistaken
Keep moving

On the road again
For months at a time
Doesn't take half that long for men about town to forget what's mine
Now my genius can't drink in silence
She's gotta listen to your tired-ass lines
I know it's hard to believe the good-hearted woman
Could have a body that'd make your daddy cry

Why the long face, jerkoff? Your chance has been taken
Good one
You may think like an animal
If you try that cat-and-mouse shit, you'll get bitten
Keep moving


Mr. Tillman, good to see you again
There's a few outstanding charges just before we check you in
Let's see here, you left your passport in the mini fridge
And a message with the desk says here the picture isn't his
And oh, just a reminder about our policy:
Don't leave your mattress in the rain if you sleep on the balcony
Okay, did you and your guests have a pleasant stay?
What a beautiful tattoo that young man had on his face
And oh, will you need a driver out to Philly?
Jason Isbell's here as well
And he seemed a little worried about you

I'm feeling good
Damn, I'm feeling so fine
I'm living on a cloud above an island in my mind
Oh baby, don't be alarmed this is just my vibe
No need to walk around
No, it's not too bad to climb

Mr. Tillman, for the seventh time
We have no knowledge of a film that is being shot outside
Those aren't extras in a movie; they're our clientele
No, they aren't running lines and they aren't exactly thrilled
Would you like a regalo on the patio?
Is there someone we can call?
Perhaps you shouldn't drink alone

I'm feeling good
Damn, I'm feeling so fine
I'm living on a cloud above an island in my mind
Oh baby, don't be alarmed this is just my vibe
No need to walk around
No, it's not too bad to climb

What's there to lose
For a ghost in a cheap rental suit
Clinging to a rock that is hurtling through space?

And what's to regret
For a speck on a speck on a speck
Made more ridiculous the more serious he gets?

Oh, it's easy to forget

Oh, I read somewhere
That in twenty years
More or less
This human experiment will reach its violent end
But I look at you
As our second drinks arrive
The piano player's playing "This Must Be the Place"
And it's a miracle to be alive

One more time

There's nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear

Dance like a butterfly and drink like a fish
If you're bent on taking demons down with only your fist
And I've never known anyone who could lose himself in a bigger paper bag
The weaker the signal, the sweeter the noise
Hunching over an instrument that you now employ
Like the Starvation Army needs a marching piano in the band
Are you feeling used?
I do

Oh, I was pissing on the flame
Like a child with cash or a king on cocaine
I've got the world by the balls
Am I supposed to behave?

What a fraud
What a con
You're the only
One I love

It's easy to assume that you've built some rapport
With a someone who only likes you for what you like yourself for
Okay, you be my mirror but remember the only a few angles I tend to prefer
I'm only here to serve

Oh, I was pissing on the flame
Like a child with cash or a king on cocaine
I've got the world by the balls
Am I supposed to behave?

Oh, I was dancing 'round the flame
Like a high-wire act with a "who, me?" face
I was living on nothing but water and cake

What a fraud
What a con
You're the only
One I love

One I love
One I love

It got too hot and so we overthrew the system
'Cause there's no place for human existence like right here
On this bright blue marble orbited by trash
Man, there's no beating that
It was no big thing to give up the way of life we had

Oh ho oh

My social life is now quite a bit less hectic
The nightlife and the protests are pretty scarce
Now I mostly spend the long days walking through the city
Empty as a tomb
Sometimes I miss the top of the food chain
But what a perfect afternoon

Industry and commerce toppled to their knees
The gears of progress halted
The underclass set free
The super-ego shatters with our ideologies
The obscene injunction to enjoy life
Disappears as in a dream
And as we return to out native state
To our primal scene
The temperature, it started dropping
The ice floes began to freeze

From time to time we all get a bit restless
With no one advertising to us constantly
But the tribe at the former airport
Some nights has meat and dancing
If you don't mind gathering and hunting
We're all still pretty good at eating on the run
Things it would have been helpful to know before the revolution

Though I'll admit some degree of resentment
For the sudden lack of convenience around here
But there are some visionaries among us developing some products
To aid us in our struggle to survive

On this godless rock that refuses to die
I was living on the hill
By the water tower and hiking trails
And when the big one hit I’d have a seat
To watch masters abandon their dogs and dogs run free
Oh baby, it’s time to leave
Take the van and the hearse down to New Orleans
Leave under the gaze of the billboard queens
Five-foot chicks with parted lips selling sweatshop jeans

These L.A. phonies and their bullshit bands
That sound like dollar signs and Amy Grant
So reads the pulled quote from my last cover piece
Entitled "The Oldest Man in Folk Rock Speaks”
You can hear it all over the airwaves
The manufactured gasp of the final days
Someone should tell them ‘bout the time that they don’t have
To praise the glorious future and the hopeless past

A few things the songwriter needs
Arrows of Love, a mask of Tragedy
But if you want ecstasy or birth control
Just run the tap until the water’s cold
Anything else you can get online
A creation myth or a .45
You're going to need one or the other to survive
Where only the armed or the funny make it out alive

Mara taunts me 'neath the tree
She's like, "Oh great, that's just what we all need
Another white guy in 2017
Who takes himself so goddamn seriously."
She's not far off, the strange thing is
That's pretty much what I thought when I started this
It took me my whole life to learn to the play the G
But the role of Oedipus was a total breeze

Still I dreamt of garnering all rave reviews
Just believably a little north of God's own truth
He's a national treasure now, and here's the proof
In the form of his major label debut
A little less human with each release
Closing the gap between the mask and me
I swear I'll never do this, but is it okay?
Don't want to be that guy but it's my birthday
If everything ends with the photo then I'm on my way

Ohhh-ho-o-oh oh-ho-ho-ho-oh

I watched my old gods all collapse
Were way more violent than my cartoon past
It's like my father said before he croaked
"Son, you're killing me, and that's all folks."
So why is it I'm so distraught
That what I'm selling is getting bought
At some point you just can't control
What people use your fake name for

So I never learned to play the lead guitar
I always more preferred the speaking parts
Besides there's always someone willing to
Fill up the spaces that I couldn't use
Nonetheless, I've been practicing my whole life
Washing dishes, playing drums, and getting by
Until I figured, if I'm here then I just might
Conceal my lack of skill here in the spotlights
Maya, the mother of illusions, a beard, and I

2000 years or so since Ovid taught
Night-blooming, teenage rosebuds, dirty talk
And I'm merely a minor fascination to
Manic virginal lust and college dudes
I'm beginning to begin to see the end
Of how it all goes down between me and them
Some 10-verse chorus-less diatribe
Plays as they all jump ship, "I used to like this guy
This new shit really kinda makes me wanna die"

Ohhh-ho-oh-oh oh-ho-ho-ho-oh
Ohhh-ho-oh-oh oh-ho-ho-ho-oh

My first memory of music's from
The time at JCPenney's with my mom
The watermelon candy I was choking on
Barbara screaming, "Someone help my son!"
I relive it most times the radio's on
That "tell me lies, sweet little white lies" song
That's when I first saw the comedy won't stop for
Even little boys dying in the department store

So we leave town in total silence
New Year's Day, it's 6 o'clock AM
I've never seen Sunset this abandoned
Reminds me predictably of the world's end
It'll be good to get more space
God knows what all these suckers paid
I can stop drinking and you can write your script
But what we both think now is...
People, we're only people
There's not much anyone can do, really do about that
But it hasn't stopped us yet
People, we know so little about ourselves
But just enough to wanna be nearly anybody else
How does that add up?

Oh, friends, all my friends
Oh, I hope you're somewhere smiling
Just know I think about you more kindly than you and I have ever been
And I'll see you the next time around the bend

People, what's the deal?
You've been hurt
And I've been hurt
But what do we do now?
People, we're only people
There ain't a thing one person can ever change about that

Oh, friends, all my friends
Oh, I hope you're somewhere smiling
Just know I think about you more kindly than you and I have ever been
And I'll see you the next time around the bend

I think the end of it all may look a lot like the beginning
Passed around from hand to hand
Screaming for no particular reason
The company gets pretty thin
So we start to shed all our distinctions
So why not me?
Why not you?
Why not now?

Another night on the straights
All bug-eyed and babbling
Out on the corner
Of 7th and 8th

I'm in the business of living
Yeah that's something I'd say
All I need is a new friend
I'm only five blocks away

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer

Beware the man who has everything
Everything that he wants
You can spot him from a mile away
In his gold chain and only one pair of socks

I'm out here testing the maxim
That all good things have to stop
The bar closes at 5
But the big man is just opening shop

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer
But now I'm in trouble

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
I need some company
I swear, just one more night longer

One more wasted morning
When I could be holding you
To my side somebody stop this joyless joy ride
I'm feeling older than my thirty-five years

One more cryptic message
Thinking that I might end it
Oh god, you must have woken up
To me saying that it's all too much
I'll take it easy with the morbid stuff

Honey I'm worried 'bout you
You're too much to lose
You're all that I have
And, honey I'm worried 'bout you
Put yourself in my shoes
You're all that I have so please don't die
Wherever you are tonight

All these pointless benders
With reptilian strangers
Oh my god you're so naive
You leave this world in a drunken heap
Who'll make the arrangements, baby, them or me?

Honey I'm worried 'bout you
You're too much to lose
You're all that I have
And, honey I'm worried 'bout you
Put yourself in my shoes
You're all that I have
You're all that I have
You're all that I have
So please don't die
Wherever you are tonight
Like a pervert on a crowded bus
A glare of love bears down on us
Like a carcass left out in the heat
This love is bursting out of me

Disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all
And a love that last forever really can't be that special
Sure we know our roles, and how it's supposed to go
Does everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?

Like an oil tanker tipped at sea
This love's contaminated me
Like a constant twitching in my eye
This love of ours will never die

Disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all
And a love that last forever really can't be that special
Sure we know our roles, how it's supposed to go
Does everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?
The comedy of man starts like this
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so Nature, she divines this alternative
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just waiting until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all powerful being endowed this horror show with meaning

Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks, these unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics

Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents the cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left
Just random matter suspended in the dark
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got
