I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the mash, they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash, it caught on in a flash
They did the mash, they did the monster mash
The zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
Out from his coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
Mash good!
Easy, Igor, you impetuous young boy
Mash good! Grrr!

I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walkin' through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was lookin' for the place called Lee Ho Fooks
For to get a big dish of beef chow mein

Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street!
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
We saw Elm Street and man it was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!
It was burnin in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin from behind
It said, ";You cut off 'Heavy Metal' and now you must die!";
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside my drawers and screamed, ";So long, cuz!";
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin
Then thought, ";Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin";
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said, ";Here's what we'll do.
We gotta lotta work here, me and you.
The souls of your friends you and I will claim.
You've got the body, and I've got the brain.";
I said, ";Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong.
I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work.
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!";
I patted him on the shoulder said, ";Thanks for stopping by.";
Then I opened up the door and said, ";Take care guy!";
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ";Hold up, that hurt!";
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ";Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.";
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ";Oh please do somethin with Fred!";
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ";Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.";
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street
It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness take sit's toll
But listen closely
Magenta:
Not for very much longer
Riff-Raff:
I've got to keep control
I remember doing the timewarp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me
Both:
And the void would be calling
All:
Let's do the Timewarp again
Let's do the Timewarp again
Narrator:
It's just a jump to the left
All:
And then a step to the right
Narrator:
Put your hands on your hips
All:
And bend your knees in time
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the Timewarp again
Let's do the Timewarp again
Magenta:
It's so dreamy
Oh fantasy free me
So you can't see me
No not at all
In another dimension
With voyeuristic intension
Well secluded
I'll see all
Riff-Raff:
With a bit of a mind flip
Magenta:
You're into the time slip
Riff-Raff:
And nothing can ever be the same
Magenta:
You're spaced out on sensation
Riff-Raff:
Like you're under sedation
All:
Let's do the Timewarp again
Let's do the Timewarp again
Columbia:
Well I was walking down the street just a having a think
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
He shook-a me up, he took me by surprise
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again
Narrator:
It's just a jump to the left
All:
And then a step to the right
Narrator:
With your hands on your hips
All:
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the Timewarp again
Let's do the Timewarp again
Boys and girls of every age

Pumpkins scream in the dead of night

Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red

Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair

Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town, don't we love it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise

Something's waiting no to pounce, and how you'll
Scream! This is Halloween
Red 'n' black, and slimy green

Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice
Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream, everybody scream
In our town of Halloween!
I am the clown with the tear-away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the "who" when you call, "Who's there?"

Filling your dreams to the brim with fright

Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee

Our man Jack is King of the Pumpkin patch
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King, now!
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah
Ahahahahahahahaha
I'm gonna bring it tonight
Ahahahahahahahaha
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer thriller tonight
Ahahahahahahahaha
I'm gonna thrill ya tonight
Get up, get up
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill ya tonight 
I'm gonna thrill ya tonight 
Ooh, babe
I'm gonna thrill ya tonight
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
Get up, get up (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
'Cause this is thriller
Spooky scary skeletons
Send shivers down your spine
Shrieking skulls will shock your soul
Seal your doom tonight
Spooky scary skeletons
Speak with such a screech
You'll shake and shudder in surprise
When you hear these zombies shriek
We're so sorry skeletons
You're so misunderstood
You only want to socialize
But I don't think we should
Cause spooky scary skeletons
Shout startling shrilly screams
They'll sneak from their sarcophagus
And just won't leave you be
Spirits supernatural
Are shy whats all the fuss
But bags of bones seem so unsafe
It's semi-serious!
Spooky scary skeletons
Are silly all the same
They'll smile and scrabble slowly by
And drive you so insane
Sticks and stones will break your bones
They seldom let you snooze
Spooky scary skeletons
Will wake you with a boo
When the crypt doors creak
And the tombstones quake
Spooks come out for a singing wake
Happy haunts materialize
And begin to vocalize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
Now don't close your eyes
And don't try to hide
Or a silly spook may sit by your side
Shrouded in a daft disguise
They pretend to terrorize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
As the moon climbs high o'er dead oak tree
Spooks arrive for the midnight spree
Creepy creeps with eerie eyes
Start to shriek and harmonize
Grim grinning ghosts come out socialize
When you hear the knell of a requiem bell
Weird glows gleam where spirits dwell
Restles bones etherealize
Rise as spooks of every size
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
Grim grinning ghosts come out
Grim grinning ghosts come out
To socialize
Now, gather 'round while I elucidate
On what happens outside when it gets late
'Long about midnight the ghosts and banshees
Get together for their nightly jamborees
There's ghosts with horns and saucer eyes
And some with fangs about this size
Some short and fat, some tall and thin
And some don't even bother to wear their skin
I'm tellin' you brother, it's a frightful sight
To see what goes on in the night
When the spooks have a midnight jamboree
They break it up with fiendish glee
Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed
Is the Headless Horseman, he's the worst
When he goes a-joggin' 'cross the land
Holdin' a noggin in his hand
Demons take one look and groan
And hit the road for parts unknown
And there's no wraith like a spook that's spurned
They don't like him, and he's really burned
He swears to the longest day he's dead
He'll show them that he can get a head
So close all the windows, lock the doors
Unless you're careful, he'll get yours
Don't think he'll hesitate a bit
'Cause he'll flip your top if it'll fit
And he likes 'em little, likes 'em big
Part in the middle, or a wig
Black or white or even red
The Headless Horseman needs a head
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a top to chop
So don't stop to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
So after dark, you kids be good
Stay at home, the way that you should
'Cause right outside, and waitin' there
Is the Headless horseman 
Beware
Who's watching
Tell me who's watching
Who's watching me
I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from 9 to 5, hey hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone, in my average home
But why do I always feel
Like I'm in the Twilight Zone?
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night
I bang the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Or can the people on TV see me
or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower
I'm afraid to wash my hair
Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there!
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why...
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Who's playing tricks on me?
I don't know anymore!
Are the neighbours watching me?
(Who's watching)
Well is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now
Who?
The IRS?!
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me is it just a dream?
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Who's playing tricks on me?
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Oooh, whoa-oa-oa
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me, can it be?
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Can I have my privacy?
